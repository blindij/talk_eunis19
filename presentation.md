# The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)

NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates cooperation on
research and research infrastructure across the Nordic and Baltic region.
<p>
In 2018 NeIC organized 11 project, of which CodeRefinery is one, with a project staff of 158
people from all Nordic countries and Estonia.
<p>
NeIC will be the coordinater of the European Open Science Cloud-Nordic and lead
a Work Package on FAIR data, starting 1 September 2019

## CodeRefinery

We are working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

## How are CodeRefinery working with all these people?

We teach tools and practices for the development of reproducible and reusable
research software during a three-day workshop.

## The content of the workshop is
* Basic and collaborative Git
* Git branch design
* Code documentation
* Automated testing
* Jupyterlab/ Jupyter Notebooks
* Integrated Development Environments
* Building portable code with CMake
* Social coding and open software
* Modular code development
* Reproducible research
