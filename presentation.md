NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates cooperation on
research and research infrastructure across the Nordic and Baltic region.
<p>
In 2018 NeIC organized 11 project, of which CodeRefinery is one, with a project staff of 158
people from all Nordic countries and Estonia.
<p>
NeIC will be the coordinater of the European Open Science Cloud-Nordic and lead
a Work Package on FAIR data, starting 1 September 2019.

## CodeRefinery

We are working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

<img src="images/Logo_COLOR_2D-01.png" style="width:75%;"/>

???
* CodeRefinery was started late 2016
* Currently the project is in its second project period, ending autumn 2021
* The project aim for establishing a network of CodeRefinery instructores (similar to the Carpentries)

## How are CodeRefinery working with all these people?

We teach tools and practices for the development of reproducible and reusable
research software during a three-day workshop.

--

## The content of the workshop is
* Basic and collaborative Git
* Git branch design
* Code documentation
* Automated testing
* Jupyterlab/ Jupyter Notebooks
* Integrated Development Environments
* Building portable code with CMake
* Social coding and open software
* Modular code development
* Reproducible research

???
* The format is very similar to the Software Carpentries
* It is talk, type along, discussions and exercises - all interleaved

## The CodeRefinery Workshops have been arranged all over the Nordic reigon

- https://coderefinery.org/workshops/

???
* Currently more than 20 workshops all over the Nordic Region + Estonia
* Approx. 600 people have been Workshop participants
* Four workshops this month (Chalmers, Univ. Helsinki, Univ. of Oslo, Univ. of Alborg)

## The Workshops participants comes from many disciplines

## The Workshops participants has a varied background

## Programming experience is very varied

## The Workshop participants exposure to version control

## The Workshop participants experience with code review

---

## The Workshop participants experience with automated testing

<img src"images/automated-testing.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

???
There is some clear parallels between code review and automated testing on the
software side and part of the scientific process on other side:
- peer review
- calibration

---

## Peer review of paper is a established principle

## Peer review of code is very close, but much less common

## Simulations and analysis with untested software do not constitute science

"Before relying on a new experimental device, an experimental scientist always
establishes its accuracy. A new detector is calibrated when the scientist
observes its responses to known input signals. The results of this
calibration are compared against the expected response. **An experimental
scientist would never conduct an experiment with uncalibrated detectors** - that
would be unscientific. So too, simulations and analysis with untested
software do not constitute science."
(copied from [Testing and Continuous Integration with Python](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/),
created by Kathryn Huff, see also the Testing chapter in
[Effective Computation In Physics](http://physics.codes) by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff)

.quote["I don't have time to learn how the instrument works, I am a chemist"]
.cite[experimental spectroscopist]

Compare these two:

.quote["we don't need tests, we are not a software company"]

.quote["we don't need a NMR calibration sample, we are not a pharma company"]

Software is logical machine/device

## The Open Science Research life cycle

<img src="images/OpenScienceResearchInitiative-ResearchLifecycle.png" style="width:90%;"/>

???
There is very little mentioning of FAIR software when Open Access and Open Data
is discussed.
Code Review and Automated testing is core to the Open Science Research Life
Cycle to be viable.

## CodeRefinery recommendations

* Encourage students/staff to take training
* Support training activities; take part in the Software Carpentries and
  CodeRefinery
* Encourage sharing and open source
* Promote FAIR-principles, not only by talks and presentations - use the
  principles in pilot projects
* FAIR principles apply both to humans and machines - data and software must be
  FAIR for both
