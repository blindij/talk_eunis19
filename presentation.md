NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates cooperation on
research and research infrastructure across the Nordic and Baltic region.
<p>
In 2018 NeIC organized 11 project, of which CodeRefinery is one, with a project staff of 158
people from all Nordic countries and Estonia.
<p>
NeIC will be the coordinator of the European Open Science Cloud-Nordic and lead
a Work Package on FAIR data, starting 1 September 2019.

???

The staff of 158 people are from all the Nordic countries and Estonia

## CodeRefinery

We are working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

<img src="images/Logo_COLOR_2D-01.png" style="width:75%;"/>

???
* CodeRefinery was started late 2016
* Currently the project is in its second project period, ending autumn 2021
* The project aim for establishing a network of CodeRefinery instructors (similar to the Carpentries)
* Findable, Accessible, Inter-operable, Reusable - FAIR - https://www.go-fair.org/

## How are we (CodeRefinery) working with all these people?

We teach tools and practices for the development of reproducible and reusable
research software during a three-day workshop.

--

## The content of the workshop is
* Basic and collaborative Git
* Git branch design
* Code documentation
* Automated testing
* Jupyterlab/ Jupyter Notebooks
* Integrated Development Environments
* Building portable code with CMake
* Social coding and open software
* Modular code development
* Reproducible research

???
* The format is very similar to the Software Carpentry
* It is talk, type along, discussions and exercises - all interleaved
* A lot of focus on Git and GitHub
* Reproducible research contains exercises with Snakemake, make and using Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/

## The CodeRefinery Workshops have been arranged all over the Nordic region

<img src="images/map.jpg" style="width: 50%;"/>

- https://coderefinery.org
- https://coderefinery.org/workshops/

???
* Currently more than 20 workshops all over the Nordic Region + Estonia
* Approx. 600 people have been Workshop participants
* Four workshops this month (Chalmers, Univ. Helsinki, Univ. of Oslo, Univ. of Alborg) 

---

## The Workshops participants comes from many disciplines 

<img src="images/scientific-discipline.png" style="width: 80%;"/>

???
* Good representation from traditional computational disciplines.
* Many disciplines represented, though

---

## The Workshops participants have a varied background

<img src="images/position_pie.png" style="width: 125%;"/>

---
## Programming experience is very varied

<img src="images/programming-experience.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

---

## The Workshop participants exposure to version control

<img src="images/version-control.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

---

## The Workshop participants experience with code review

<img src="images/code-review.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

---

## The Workshop participants experience with automated testing

<img src="images/automated-testing.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

???
There is some clear parallels between code review and automated testing on the
software side and part of the scientific process on other side:
- peer review
- calibration

---

## Peer review of paper is a established principle

<img src="images/sharing-papers.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>

---

## Peer review of code is very close, but much less common

## Simulations and analysis with untested software do not constitute science

"Before relying on a new experimental device, an experimental scientist always
establishes its accuracy. A new detector is calibrated when the scientist
observes its responses to known input signals. The results of this
calibration are compared against the expected response. **An experimental
scientist would never conduct an experiment with uncalibrated detectors** - that
would be unscientific. So too, simulations and analysis with untested
software do not constitute science."
(copied from [Testing and Continuous Integration with Python](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/),
created by Kathryn Huff, see also the Testing chapter in
[Effective Computation In Physics](http://physics.codes) by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff)

.quote["I don't have time to learn tool X, I am a chemist"]
.cite[developer of QC code]

.quote["I don't have time to learn how the instrument works, I am a chemist"]
.cite[experimental spectroscopist]

Compare these two:

.quote["we don't need tests, we are not a software company"]

.quote["we don't need a NMR calibration sample, we are not a pharma company"]

Software is a logical machine/device

## The Open Science Research life cycle

<img src="images/OpenScienceResearchInitiative-ResearchLifecycle.png" style="width:90%;"/>

???
- There is very little mentioning of FAIR software when Open Access and Open Data is discussed.
- Code Review and Automated testing will be central to the Open Science Research Life
Cycle for it to be viable.

---

## A closer look at the Process part of the Research life cycle

<img src="images/OpenScienceProcessing.jpg" style="width: 90%;"/>

???

* Software is the twin of data.
* No FAIR Open Data without FAIR Open Software.
* The High Energy Physics Software Foundation, HSF is very explicit about their
  dependency on Open Data and Open Software for advancing their field.
* This is emerging in other disciplines as well, but not so strongly expressed (system biology?)
* How do our participants fit into this picture?

---

## Has the Workshops participants' software become more usable?

<img src="images/yes_no_questions.png" style="width: 60%;"/>

---

## Are the Workshops participants using the different tools CodeRefinery has introduced?

<img src="images/heatmap.png" style="width: 60%;"/>

???
* To some extent the participants are picking up the tools and methods
  taught during the workshop

## CodeRefinery recommendations

* Encourage students/staff to take training.
* Support training activities; take part in the Software Carpentries and
  CodeRefinery; contribute to a network of instructors.
* Encourage sharing and open source.
* Promote FAIR-principles, not only by talks and presentations - use the
  principles in pilot projects.
* FAIR principles apply both to humans and machines - data and software must be
  FAIR for both.

???
* To get involved in this type of training is a good opportunity to engage with
  people working at the research frontier. Their problems and obstacles are
  challenges for one of a university's core activities.
* Huge demand for training.
