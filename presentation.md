NeIC is hosted by NordForsk, which provides for and facilitates cooperation on
research and research infrastructure across the Nordic and Baltic region.
<p>
In 2018 NeIC organized 11 project, of which CodeRefinery is one, with a project staff of 158
people from all Nordic countries and Estonia.
<p>
NeIC will be the coordinater of the European Open Science Cloud-Nordic and lead
a Work Package on FAIR data, starting 1 September 2019

## CodeRefinery

We are working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

???
* CodeRefinery was started late 2018
* Currently the project is in its second project period, ending autumn 2021
* The project aim for establishing a network of CodeRefinery teachers (similar to the Carpentries)

## How are CodeRefinery working with all these people?

We teach tools and practices for the development of reproducible and reusable
research software during a three-day workshop.

--

## The content of the workshop is
* Basic and collaborative Git
* Git branch design
* Code documentation
* Automated testing
* Jupyterlab/ Jupyter Notebooks
* Integrated Development Environments
* Building portable code with CMake
* Social coding and open software
* Modular code development
* Reproducible research

???
* The format is very similar to the Software Carpentries
* It is talk, type along, discussions and exercises - all interleaved

???
* Currently more than 20 workshops all over the Nordic Region + Estonia
* Approx. 600 people have been Workshop participants
* Four workshops this month (Chalmers, Univ. Helsinki, Univ. of Oslo, Univ. of Alborg)

## CodeRefinery recommendations

* Encourage students/staff to take training
* Support training activities; take part in the Software Carpentries and
  CodeRefinery
* Encourage sharing and open source
* Promote FAIR-principles, not only by talks and presentations - use the
  principles in pilot projects
* FAIR principles apply both to humans and machines - data and software must be
  FAIR for both
