## CodeRefinery

We are working with students, researchers, Research Software Engineers from all disciplines and national e-infrastructure partners to advance FAIRness of Software management and development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

## How are CodeRefinery working with all these people?

We teach tools and practices for the development of reproducible and reusable
research software during a three-day workshop.
